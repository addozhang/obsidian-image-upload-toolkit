## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Cannot locate image" Error
**Cause**: Incorrect image path configuration or missing files
**Solution**:
1. Check Obsidian's attachment folder settings
2. Verify image files exist at specified paths
3. Try using absolute paths for testing

#### Imgur Upload Failures
**Cause**: API limits or network issues
**Solution**:
1. Verify Client ID is correct
2. Wait a few minutes and retry (Imgur has rate limits)
3. Consider alternative storage services

#### Relative Paths Not Working
**Cause**: Plugin version or path resolution issues
**Solution**:
1. Update to latest version
2. Use relative paths starting with `./` or `../`
3. Check Obsidian's attachment settings

#### Progress Modal Not Showing
**Cause**: Settings issue or plugin conflicts
**Solution**:
1. Verify "Show progress modal" setting is enabled
2. Restart Obsidian
3. Check for conflicting plugins

#### Upload Errors with Special Characters
**Cause**: Filename encoding issues
**Solution**:
1. Avoid special characters in filenames
2. Use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
3. Check filename encoding in your file system

#### Web Image Download Failures
**Cause**: Network issues, CORS restrictions, or authentication requirements
**Solution**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the web image URL is accessible
3. Some images may require authentication and cannot be downloaded
4. Disable "Upload web images" if you only want to process local images

## 📈 Best Practices

### Workflow Recommendations
1. **Backup Important Data** - Always backup before uploading
2. **Test Configuration** - Use test images to verify setup
3. **Choose Appropriate Storage** - Match service to your use case
4. **Monitor Links** - Regularly check uploaded image URLs

### Performance Optimization
- Process smaller files first when batch uploading
- Use local storage services when network is unstable
- Regularly clean up unused configuration cache

### Security Guidelines
- Never share API keys publicly
- Rotate access credentials regularly
- Use minimum required permissions for storage services

### File Organization
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Organize images by date or project
- Consider using path variables for automatic organization
