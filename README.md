# Obsidian Image Upload Toolkit

This plugin cloud upload all local images embedded in markdown to specified remote image store
(support [imgur](https://imgur.com),[AliYun OSS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/object-storage-service) and [Imagekit](https://imagekit.io), currently) and export markdown with image urls to clipboard directly.
The origin markdown in vault is still using local images.

It will be help for publishing to the static site such [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).

The idea of plugin comes from the powerful markdown editor [MWeb Pro](https://www.mweb.im) I have been 
used for years. 

During plugin development, I also referred to plugins [obsidian-imgur-plugin](https://github.com/gavvvr/obsidian-imgur-plugin)
(**the imgur uploading codes is from it**) and [obsidian-image-auto-upload-plugin](https://github.com/renmu123/obsidian-image-auto-upload-plugin). Thanks both for 
providing such great plugins.

This plugin is listed in the [Obsidian community plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=image-upload-toolkit) now.

## Usage

Open command and type "publish page", it will upload all local images to remote store 
and copy markdown with replaced image syntax to clipboard with notification.

## Appendix

### Imgur Users: Obtaining your own Imgur Client ID

Imgur service usually has a daily [upload limits](https://apidocs.imgur.com/#rate-limits). To overcome this, create and use your own Client ID. This is generally easy, by following the steps below :

1. If you do not have an imgur.com account, [create one](https://imgur.com/register) first.

2. Visit [https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient) and generate **Client ID** for Obsidian with following settings:
	- provide any application name, i.e. "Obsidian"
	- choose "OAuth 2 authorization without a callback URL" (**important**)
	- Add your E-Mail

3. Copy the Client ID. (Note: You only need **Client ID**. The Client secret is a private info that is not required by this plugin. Keep it safe with you)
4. Paste this Client ID in plugin settings
